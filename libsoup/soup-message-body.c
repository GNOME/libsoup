 *
 * #SoupMessageBody represents the request or response body of a
 * #SoupMessage.
 *
 * In addition to #SoupMessageBody, libsoup also defines a "smaller"
 * data buffer type, #SoupBuffer, which is primarily used as a
 * component of #SoupMessageBody. In particular, when using chunked
 * encoding to transmit or receive a message, each chunk is
 * represented as a #SoupBuffer.
 **/

/**
 * SoupMemoryUse:
 * @SOUP_MEMORY_STATIC: The memory is statically allocated and
 * constant; libsoup can use the passed-in buffer directly and not
 * need to worry about it being modified or freed.
 * @SOUP_MEMORY_TAKE: The caller has allocated the memory for the
 * #SoupBuffer's use; libsoup will assume ownership of it and free it
 * (with g_free()) when it is done with it.
 * @SOUP_MEMORY_COPY: The passed-in data belongs to the caller; the
 * #SoupBuffer will copy it into new memory, leaving the caller free
 * to reuse the original memory.
 * @SOUP_MEMORY_TEMPORARY: The passed-in data belongs to the caller,
 * but will remain valid for the lifetime of the #SoupBuffer. The
 * difference between this and @SOUP_MEMORY_STATIC is that if you copy
 * a @SOUP_MEMORY_TEMPORARY buffer, it will make a copy of the memory
 * as well, rather than reusing the original memory.
 *
 * Describes how #SoupBuffer should use the data passed in by the
 * caller.
 *
 * See also soup_buffer_new_with_owner(), which allows to you create a
 * buffer containing data which is owned by another object.
