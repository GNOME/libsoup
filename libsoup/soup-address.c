 * #SoupAddress represents the address of a TCP connection endpoint:
 * both the IP address and the port. (It is somewhat like an
 * object-oriented version of struct sockaddr.)
 *
 * Although #SoupAddress is still used in some libsoup API's, it
 * should not be used in new code; use GLib's #GNetworkAddress or
 * #GSocketAddress instead.
