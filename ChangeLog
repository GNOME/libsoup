2002-12-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_https_connect_cb): We never want to
	release the connection on message free, even if the connection was
	unsuccessful.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_get_iochannel_real): Call
	g_io_channel_set_close_on_unref() on the second half of the socket
	pair so we don't leak file descriptors.

2002-12-03  Frank Belew	 <frb@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: add signal.h to the list of headers to 
	pick up SIGKILL
	
2002-11-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Build the tests directory again

2002-11-21  Rodney Dawes  <dobey@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Don't require autoconf 2.5x, needs to work with 2.13
	
2002-11-20  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: require autoconf 2.52 not 2.53.

2002-11-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_hash): Don't use s6_addr32
	since it's apparently non-portable. Use s6_addr instead.
	(soup_gethostbyaddr): fix a sometimes-uninitialized variable.

	* libsoup/soup-error.c: Fix spelling of
	SOUP_ERROR_MOVED_PERMANENTLY and its description.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_get_request_header, etc):
	Remove long-deprecated API.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_connect): remove unused
	variable.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_read): Use gsize.
	* libsoup/soup-server.c (cgi_read): Likewise
	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_socks_write, soup_socks_read):
	Likewise.
	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (soup_ssl_proxy_readwrite): Likewise.
	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_cb,
	soup_transfer_write_cb): Likewise.

	* tests/timeserver.c: Add "-6" to listen on the IPv6 local address
	instead of IPv4. (Tested on OS X.)

2002-11-15  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/*: Change old Helix Code refs to Ximian (and update
	copyright dates).

2002-11-15  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: uncomment lines to make timeserver build 
	correctly
	
2002-11-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_new): When we get an
	address from the hash, call our address lookup callback or else
	the connection will hang.

2002-11-13  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* tests/timeserver.c: Oops, commit this.

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): reenable timeserver.

2002-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Replace the BINDIR define with LIBEXECDIR.
	(install-exec-hook): Install libsoup-ssl-proxy into libexecdir
	instead of bindir.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_close): Call SSL_shutdown()
	to properly shut down the SSL connection before closing the
	socket.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (soup_ssl_proxy_readwrite): Close the
	iochannels before quitting the main loop.

	* tests/Makefile.am: disable building timeserver, the source file
	wasn't added.

2002-11-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Check for IPv6 support in networking headers.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Make the internal structure of
	SoupAddress entirely private, and make SoupAddress be more like a
	hostent and less like a sockaddr. (Ie, make it not have a port
	associated with it.) Document undocumented functions. Add
	completely-untested support for IPv6.
	(soup_address_new_from_sockaddr): New, to parse a sockaddr into a
	SoupAddress and a port.
	(soup_address_ipv4_any, soup_address_ipv6_any): Return static
	addresses corresponding to the IPv6 and IPv6 "any" addresses.
	(soup_address_get_canonical_name): Use inet_ntop/inet_ntoa.
	(soup_address_make_sockaddr): Now constructs a new sockaddr, which
	may be a sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6.
	(soup_address_gethostname, soup_address_gethostaddr): Remove
	these. They aren't reliable, especially on multihomed hosts.
	(soup_gethostbyname, soup_gethostbyaddr): support IPv6
	(soup_address_new): Keep pending lookups in a separate hash table
	from completed lookups. Fix a bug when canceling a lookup when
	there was more one outstanding request for it.
	(soup_address_lookup_in_cache): Removed.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Add a port field to SoupSocket (since
	it's not in SoupAddress any more).
	(soup_socket_connect): Simplify this. Don't use
	soup_address_lookup_in_cache, just call soup_address_new, since we
	already know the code can deal with the callback being invoked
	immediately.
	(soup_socket_new_sync, soup_socket_new): Take a port argument.
	(soup_socket_server_new): Take a SoupAddress to use as the local
	address to bind to. This lets the caller choose between the IPv4
	and IPv6 "any" addresses, and also lets you bind to a single
	interface of a multi-homed machine.
	(soup_socket_server_accept, soup_socket_server_try_accept): Merge
	the common code.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_new): Pass
	soup_address_ipv4_any() to soup_socket_server_new().

	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_connect_socks_proxy,
	soup_socks_write): Fix up for the API changes, but it won't work
	with IPv6 yet.

	* tests/timeserver.c: Another really simple test, for the server
	socket code.

	* tests/Makefile.am: build timeserver

2002-11-11  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Move the SoupAddress code from
	soup-socket.c and soup-socket-unix.c to here.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Move the remaining code from
	soup-socket-unix.c here.

	* libsoup/soup-socket-unix.c: Gone

	* tests/get.c: really really trivial test program

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT):
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): add tests/

2002-11-05  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* Split libsoup out of soup. ChangeLog.old contains the original
	soup ChangeLog.

	* Makefile.am, etc: Fix things up to work with the new directory
	layout. Disable docs until we fix them.

	* autogen.sh: Use gnome-autogen.sh

	* configure.in: Require autoconf 2.53. Remove stuff that was only
	needed for httpd or wsdl code. Remove glib1 support. Bump version
	to 2.0.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Rename library to libsoup-2.0, put includes
	in ${includedir}/soup-2.0
	
	* libsoup/*: Merge soup-0-7 back onto the trunk. Remove
	SOAP-specific stuff, Windows support, and other things that
	weren't being maintained.

	* soup-config.in, soupConf.sh: Kill these. We only support
	pkg-config now.
