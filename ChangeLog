2005-10-27  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_client_new_async,
	soup_socket_client_new_sync): unref the SoupAddress passed to
	soup_socket_connect to avoid a leak. Based on a patch from Wang
	Xin <jedy.wang@sun.com>.

2005-10-27  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	bgo #316313 / bnc #116762, and probably also bgo #318252

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_io_stop): clear io->conn
	after releasing it, to make sure we can't accidentally release it
	twice.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (clear_current_request): Call
	soup_message_io_stop() on the cleared request.

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (ntlm_authorize_post): do a
	little dance here to make sure the session can't queue another
	message on the connection while we're in the process of requeuing
	the original one.

2005-08-30  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* libsoup-zip.in: Include documentation in developer zipfile.

2005-08-22  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-message.c (soup_soap_message_class_init): Call
	g_type_class_add_private.

	* configure.in: Bump to 2.2.6.1

	* NEWS: update

2005-08-22  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bump to 2.2.6. Bump SOUP_AGE and SOUP_CURRENT for
	soup_server_get_socket() addition.

	* NEWS: update

2005-08-22  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (set_current_request,
	clear_current_request): Fix g_object_add/remove_weak_pointer usage
	to prevent a crash when canceling a request. From Tambet.

2005-08-16  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	Fix a connection leak reported by Tambet.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (send_request): rather than tracking
	the message progress via signals, call
	soup_message_send_request_internal() and have it call
	soup_connection_release() when it's done.
	(request_restarted, request_done): gone
	(clear_current_request): handle disconnecting (if necessary) and
	updating last_used time here.
	(soup_connection_release): Call clear_current_request().
	(dispose): Call clear_current_request()

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c
	(soup_message_send_request_internal): New. Takes a SoupConnection
	in addition to the other args, and passes that on to
	soup-message-io.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (SoupMessageIOData): add a
	SoupConnection field.
	(io_cleanup): if io->conn is set, unref it.
	(soup_message_io_stop): if io->conn is set, and we ended in a
	clean state, call soup_connection_release() on it.
	(soup_message_io_client): Add a SoupConnection arg, which gets
	reffed and stored in io->conn.

	* TODO: misc updates

2005-08-15  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.h (soup_connection_new):
	* libsoup/soup-server.h (soup_server_new):
	* libsoup/soup-session-async.h (soup_session_async_new_with_options): 
	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.h (soup_session_sync_new_with_options): 
	* libsoup/soup-socket.h (soup_socket_new): use G_GNUC_NULL_TERMINATED.

	* libsoup/soup-types.h (G_GNUC_NULL_TERMINATED): steal the
	definition of this from glib 2.8 for use when compiling against
	glib 2.6.

2005-08-15  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (update_fdflags, set_property): Fix compilation
	errors.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_get_listener): ditto.

2005-08-12  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_get_listener): new method to
	get the server's listening socket.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: add a new "cloexec" property, to set
	FD_CLOEXEC on the socket. Update everything for that.

2005-08-05  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (finalize): Free priv->read_buf. From
	Tambet.
	(soup_socket_connect): Make sure that get_iochannel() gets called
	if the connect succeeds right away, or the socket will fail on
	the first read or write. [#312540]

2005-08-01  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: drop version back down to 2.2.5 and
	SOUP_API_VERSION back to 2.2; due to various snafus, there has
	never yet been an official release of the 2.4 API and the GNOME
	2.12 betas have been shipping with libsoup 2.2 tarballs (while
	jhbuild has been using 2.4, with evolution and related packages
	having configure hacks to build against either). As there never
	ended up being any API-incompatible changes in the 2.4 series, we
	can just merge it back into the 2.2 series and kill off 2.4.

	* NEWS: Copy in the 2.2-series news from the gnome-2-10 branch,
	and add new NEWS

	* libsoup-zip.in: s/2.2/@SOUP_API_VERSION@/

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (libsoupincludedir, lib_LTLIBRARIES,
	libsoup_2_2_la_LDFLAGS, libsoup_2_2_la_LIBADD,
	libsoup_2_2_la_SOURCES): s/4/2/ in all the places automake won't
	let us use a variable.

2005-08-01  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-md5-utils.c (soup_md5_final_hex): Finalize a
	SoupMD5Context and write out the digest in hex digits.

	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c (authenticate, compute_response):
	* libsoup/soup-server-auth.c (check_digest_passwd): Use that,
	rather than duplicating the code in both places here.

	Patch from Wim Lewis.
	
2005-07-15  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (redirect_handler): Allow relative URIs,
	since some servers are lame. Based on a patch from Jean-Yves
	Lefort. [#270688]

	* tests/uri-parsing.c: add some more tests to make sure that
	things that should be %-escaped do get %-escaped

2005-07-06  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-date.c (soup_gmtime): Mention in the doc comment
	that gmtime() is thread-safe on Windows.
	(soup_date_generate): Use soup_gmtime() instead of gmtime_r().

2005-06-14  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: check for gmtime_r

	* libsoup/soup-date.c: date/time-manipulation functions

	* libsoup/soup-xmlrpc-message.c: 
	* libsoup/soup-xmlrpc-response.c: XMLRPC message classes, from
	Mariano Suarez-Alvarez, Fernando Herrera, and Jeff Bailey.
	[#300227]

	* tests/date.c: soup-date test code

	* tests/getbug.c: XMLRPC test code. (Should be switched to use
	bugzilla.gnome.org once bgo supports XMLRPC.)

	* TODO: XMLRPC is implemented now (but shares the problem with
	SOAP that the API is not very good).

2005-06-14  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/*.[ch]: add/fix gtk-doc comments, make functions match
	prototypes, etc

	* docs/reference/*: update, fix, etc

2005-06-13  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Check also for inet_ntop(). Pre-cache knowledge
	that we do have inet_pton() and inet_ntop() on Windows (because we
	implement them ourselves in soup-dns.c).
	
	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (inet_pton, inet_ntop): Fix the Win32
	implementations, they were completely bogus.
	(soup_dns_ntop): Make it compile if HAVE_INET_NTOP.

2005-06-08  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (ntlm_authorize_pre): Fix this to
	use just the domain name for the domain, not the whole
	DOMAIN\username. Based on a patch by Jeroen Hautekeete in #306877.

2005-05-26  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (cleanup_hosts): lock host_lock around
	this, since it can be called from set_property(). Possible fix for
	bnc #81641.

2005-05-05  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* docs/reference/Makefile.am (SCANGOBJ_OPTIONS): Use
	--type-init-func to force g_thread_init to be called. [#302674]

2005-04-18  Tor Lillqvist  <tml@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Call AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL. Check for Win32, set
	Automake conditional OS_WIN32. Pre-cache information that we do
	have getaddrinfo(), getnameinfo(), and IPv6 on Win32. (The tests
	wouldn't notice as they don't include the necessary headers or
	link with -lws2_32. Easiest to just pre-cache it.)

	* libsoup-zip.in: New file, to build zipfile-based distribution of
	libsoup for Win32. 

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST)
	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add libsoup-zip(.in).

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Use -no-undefined on Win32. Link with
	WinSock library -lws2_32.
	
	* libsoup/soup-portability.h: New file. On Unix it includes the
	traditional BSD socket etc headers. On Win32 it includes
	winsock2.h and ws2tcpip.h.

	* libsoup/*.c
	* libsoup/*.h: Correspondingly, don't include the BSD socket API
	headers directly.

	* libsoup/soup-address.h
	* libsoup/soup-dns.h: Include soup-portability.h

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_class_init): This function
	should get called before libsoup uses the WinSock API, so this is
	a good place to call WSAStartup().
	
	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c (get_protection_space): Use
	g_strsplit() instead of the relatively unportable strtok_r().

	* libsoup/soun-dns.c: Remove unused headers. Implement
	inet_pton() and inet_ntop() on Win32 using WSAStringToAddress()
	and WSAAddressToString().

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (SOUP_CLOSE_SOCKET, SOUP_IS_SOCKET_ERROR,
	SOUP_IS_INVALID_SOCKET, SOUP_IS_CONNECT_STATUS_INPROGRESS):
	Portability macros.
	(soup_socket_class_init): Call soup_address_get_type() to make
	sure WSAStartup() gets called (through soup_address_class_init()).
	(update_fdflags): Use ioctlsocket(FIONBIO) on Win32.
	(soup_socket_write): Conditionalize SIGPIPE use.
	
	* tests/get.c: mkdir() is different in Microsoft's C library.

	* tests/simple-httpd.c: Rename TRY_AGAIN label to AGAIN to avoid
	some clash with winsock2.h (which includes windows.h). The Win32
	headers pollute the namespace wildly.

2005-04-15  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (resolve_name): make this work with
	pre-EAI_OVERFLOW glibc [#300620]

2005-04-12  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Remove the various gethostbyname_r checks and just
	check for getnameinfo/getaddrinfo.

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c: de-nastify. Make this use threads instead of
	forking. Change the API around a bunch in the process.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Update for soup-dns changes

	* tests/dns.c: take multiple hostnames on the command line and
	resolve them all at once (patch from tml)

2005-04-11  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: require glib-2.0 >= 2.4.0

	* libsoup/*.c: use G_DEFINE_TYPE and
	g_type_class_add_private/G_TYPE_INSTANCE_GET_PRIVATE

	* libsoup/soup-types.h: kill SOUP_MAKE_TYPE and
	SOUP_MAKE_TYPE_WITH_IFACE

	* tests/revserver.c: use GThread. (patch from tml)

2005-04-11  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version to 2.3.0. bump SOUP_API_VERSION to
	2.4

	* libsoup.pc.in: rename from libsoup-2.2.pc.in

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST, pkgconfig_DATA, install-data-local):
	install the .pc file by hand, renaming it to include the
	SOUP_API_VERSION

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: s/2.2/2.4/

2005-03-09  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_read): return G_IO_STATUS_EOF
	if gnutls returns 0. [#73352]
	(verify_certificate): put an #ifdef around
	GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_TRUSTED so it works with gnutls 1.2.x. [#57811]

2005-01-08  Not Zed  <NotZed@Ximian.com>

	** See ximian bug #70323.

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c: replace all unsigned long/long
	types with guint32, as the code needs 32 bit longs.

2004-10-20  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c: Commit the alleged changes from the 10-06
	commit, which somehow did not actually get committed then.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (SoupConnectionPrivate): add a flag
	indicating whether or not the connection is connected.
	(tunnel_connect_finished): If successful, set connected. If the
	server returns a 3xx response, translate it to 407 (under the
	assumption that it's trying to redirect us to an HTML login page,
	as in bug 68531). Use soup_socket_start_proxy_ssl() rather than
	soup_socket_start_ssl().
	(socket_connect_result, soup_connection_connect_sync): If
	successful, set connected
	(soup_connection_disconnect): Don't emit "disconnected" if we
	aren't yet connected, or the message that was waiting for this
	connection may get stranded in the queue. (also part of 68531)

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_start_proxy_ssl): New, starts
	SSL and lets the caller pass the expected hostname. Fixes a
	problem where SSL certification validation would always fail if
	you used a proxy, because it was comparing the cert against the
	proxy's hostname. (68583)

2004-10-06  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.h (SoupSocketError): add
	SOUP_SSL_ERROR_CERTIFICATE.

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (do_handshake): Pass the GError to
	verify_certificate.
	(verify_certificate): Set the GError appropriately rather than
	spewing g_warnings.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (read_from_network, soup_socket_write): If
	the GIOChannel operation returns an error, store it as GOBject
	data on the socket (as a hack so soup-message-io.c can access it
	without us needing to change SoupSocket's API).

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (io_error): peek at the socket's
	"last_error" datum and set the message's status to SSL_FAILED
	(with the GError's message string) rather than IO_ERROR, if
	appropriate. For 64414.

2004-09-30  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_init): Add this, with some
	extra initialization needed for libgcrypt 1.2 or higher. Fixes
	66342.
	(soup_ssl_get_client_credentials,
	soup_ssl_get_server_credentials): Call soup_gnutls_init().

2004-08-26  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 2.2.0.

	* AUTHORS: Update this to reflect the last 2 years.

	* NEWS: Brief summary of 1.99.x -> 2.2 changes

	* README, TODO: Updates

2004-08-26  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/*: add/fix lots of gtk-doc comments
	
	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_str_case_hash, soup_str_case_equal):
	Fix bug noticed while documenting. (We were using the
	locale-case-insensitive functions rather than the g_ascii_ ones.)

	* libsoup/soup-message.h (SoupMessageFlags): remove the (never
	implemented) NO_PIPELINE and NO_COOKIE flags.

	* docs/reference/tmpl/*.sgml: Regenerate, fill in some stuff.
	There are still problems here with gtk-doc not recognizing many of
	the objects in libsoup...

2004-08-13  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version, libtool number

2004-08-09  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_connect_sync): Don't
	use conn after emitting the "connect_result" signal, since it
	might be destroyed by that. Based on a patch from hpj.

2004-08-02  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-uri.h: Add flag "broken_encoding" to SoupUri.

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c: (soup_uri_to_string): if broken_encoding is
	set, don't re-encode the URL parts. Based on a patch by
	Alfred.Peng@Sun.COM.

2004-07-19  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version, libtool number

2004-07-15  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.c (send_message): Simplify this. If
	the message comes back from soup_connection_send_request not
	FINISHED, get a new connection rather than reusing the old one.
	This fixes a race condition in which a connection could end up
	double-booked, and fixes the handling of messages that get
	redirected to another server.

2004-07-13  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (connect_result): If the connection
	attempt succeeded, reserve the connection before releasing
	host_lock. Otherwise, another thread might find it in the
	connection pool before the caller can queue a message on it.
	#60693

	* libsoup/soup-session-async.c (got_connection): Call
	soup_connection_release(), since we don't have a specific message
	in mind for the connection, so we need it to be considered idle.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_release): New
	function, to undo a soup_connection_reserve().
	(soup_connection_send_request, soup_connection_reserve,
	soup_connection_authenticate, soup_connection_reauthenticate):
	Document these

2004-07-12  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.c (send_message): signal the
	"connections available" condition after the message finishes. Duh.

	* libsoup-2.2.pc.in (Cflags, Libs): add XML_CFLAGS and XML_LIBS

2004-07-08  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.c: Revert previous change for now; it
	breaks the build on distros with older libxmls.

2004-07-08  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* tests/dict.c: Basic SOAP test, using Aonaware's SOAP->DICT
	gateway

2004-07-07  Fernando Herrera  <fherrera@onirica.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.c: (finalize), (init),
	(soup_soap_response_from_string): Use a parse context for the
	xml document, so we can safely use the option to ignore
	blank spaces and '\n'.

2004-07-06  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c (soup_uri_new_with_base): if the protocol is
	http or https, require a hostname. For #61049

	* tests/uri-parsing.c (rel_tests, do_uri): Update for that

2004-06-03  JP Rosevear <jpr@novell.com>

	* configure.in: bump version to 2.1.11, libtool number

2004-06-01  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Redo the various IPv4/IPv6-abstracting
	macros to not use ?: expressions as lvalues, since that's
	apparently a GNU extension.
	(soup_address_resolve_async): Use a timeout rather than an idle
	handler to poll the dns result. (soup-dns really should be
	rewritten to not require polling, but this is easier for now.)
	#59240

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (call_handler): Don't use GNU-only
	non-constant structure initialization

	* tests/dns.c: Simple test of the dns code

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): build it

2004-05-19  JP Rosevear  <jpr@novell.com>

	* configure.in (SOUP_API_VERSION): bump version, libtool numbers

2004-05-18  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.h:
	* libsoup/soup-nossl.c: define some GError codes and stuff

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c: add missing #include <gnutls/x509.h>
	(do_handshake): when returning G_IO_STATUS_AGAIN, set the GError
	to SOUP_SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_NEEDS_READ or _NEEDS_WRITE
	appropriately.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_write): Handle
	SOUP_SSL_ERROR_HANDSHAKE_NEEDS_READ, by setting an io watch for
	G_IO_IN instead of G_IO_OUT. Fixes the rcd-sucking-up-all-cpu bug
	(#58434)
	(read_from_network): Handle the reverse case (which would cause
	hanging rather than spinning, and might be the cause of some
	connector 1.5 slowness?)

2004-05-11  Dan Winship  <danw@novell.com>

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_signal_connect_once): Do this less
	kludgefully, using the magic of GClosure, to fix x86_64 problems
	reported by snorp.

2004-05-04  Sivaiah Nallagatla <snallagatla@novell.com>

        * libsoup/soup-soap-message.c (finalize) : free
        the elements of priv structure before freeing priv

2004-04-20  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (ntlm_authorize_post): if
	re-sending the message, call soup_message_restarted()
	(send_request): Connect to "restarted" signal, and remove the 401
	handlers from there; doing it here didn't work because if the
	connection was closed, the message would be re-sent on a new
	connection, but would still have the handlers from the old
	connection attached to it, which would make authentication fail.

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c (soup_message_run_handlers):
	Copy the handler list before starting, to protect against handlers
	that modify the handler list.

2004-04-15  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_connect_sync):
	Connect to the socket's "disconnect" signal. (We were only doing
	this from the async version before, which meant that synchronous
	SoupConnections could outlive their sockets and start causing
	errors.) #57004

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (send_request): Remove the old
	Authorization header before adding a new one.

2004-04-02  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: bump version, libtool number

2004-03-15  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-message.c (soup_soap_message_persist): Fix up
	types to kill a warning with -Wall -O2

2004-03-05  JP Rosevear <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: bump version, libtool number

2004-03-02  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (check_hostent): Only loop on EINTR if
	bytes_read is -1, since the value of errno is irrelevant when
	bytes_read is 0. Probably #54960.

2004-03-01  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.h: removed not-implemented function's
	prototype.

2004-02-27  Rodney Dawes  <dobey@ximian.com>

	* configure.in:
	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Use a different variable for linking to the
	static version of gnutls, so we don't pull the .a files into the .pc

	Fixes #53346

2004-02-20  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (read_metadata, read_body_chunk,
	write_data): Pass gsize *, not guint *, to soup_socket_read/write,
	to make this work on 64-bit platforms. (Grr. C type checking
	sucks.) #54631
	
	* tests/revserver.c: Likewise

2004-02-18  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	Fixes #54512

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.c (soup_soap_parameter_get_int_value):
	don't leak the value returned from xmlNodeGetContent().
	(soup_soap_parameter_get_string_value,
	soup_soap_parameter_get_property): return a g_strdup'ed
	string, not the value returned by xmlNodeGetContent, so that
	callers can use g_free, and not xmlFree.

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.h: made soup_parameter_get_property
	not return const.

2004-02-17  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-message.h (SOUP_IS_SOAP_MESSAGE_CLASS): Fix a
	typo. #54433, from Mariano Suarez-Alvarez.

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.h (SOUP_IS_SOAP_RESPONSE_CLASS):
	Likewise

2004-02-17  Rodney Dawes  <dobey@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_new): HTTP connections require
	a hostname, and we also hash on the host for message queueing in the
	session, if the host is NULL we free the SoupUri and return NULL

2004-02-14  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Use POSIX-compliant "test $foo = bar", rather than
	GNU-only "test $foo == bar". #54354, from Julio M. Merino Vidal.

2004-02-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (check_hostent): Call read() in a do-while
	loop to prevent DNS errors from short reads.

2004-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bumped version number to 2.1.7 and libtool
	current. 

2004-02-11  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_disconnect): Update
	Joe's comment here with a gory explanation of exactly what's going
	on. (It's not just an SSL bug either, it affects all connections.)

2004-02-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_disconnect): Add a
	workaround for SSL connections which time-out but don't close the
	socket until we try sending data again later.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_connect, soup_socket_listen):
	Don't free the sockaddr from soup_address_get_sockaddr(); we don't
	own it, the SoupAddress does.

2004-02-09  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump libtool numbers

2004-02-05  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (soup_session_add_filter): Ref the filter
	when adding it.
	(soup_session_remove_filter): And unref it here (we were already
	unreffing it in dispose().)

2004-02-05  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (soup_dns_entry_unref): Don't try to free the
	hostent if it's NULL.
	(soup_dns_entry_check_lookup): If the entry is resolved, but the
	hostent is NULL, uncache it.

2004-02-04  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (ntlm_authorize_pre): Always
	remove the WWW-Authenticate headers before returning, so the
	session won't fall back to Basic auth. Also, leave the connection
	in the "authenticating" state rather than setting it to
	"authenticated".
	(ntlm_authorize_post): Only requeue the message if it's in the
	"authenticating" state (and set it to "authenticated"). Fixes an
	"unepectedly disconnected" error if authentication fails.

2004-02-03  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (io_cleanup): Call
	soup_message_io_stop so we don't get a callback on the io after
	it's been cleaned up.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (add_auth): Only remove the Authorization
	header if we have another one to add. (Otherwise it messes up
	SoupConnectionNTLM.)

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (read_from_buf): Use memmove rather than
	memcpy here, since the source and destination will overlap if
	*nread is small and read_buf->len is large. (Noticed by valgrind,
	#53625.)

2004-02-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_close): Call gnutls_bye()
	with the GNUTLS_SHUT_WR flag (instead of RDWR) and check only for
	GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.  GNUTLS_E_AGAIN will be returned by recv()
	when there are no messages on the wire on a non-blocking socket.
	This sends a SSL hangup message and then allows us to immediately
	close the socket.

2004-01-30  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: bumped version number to 2.1.6.

2004-01-29  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.[ch] (soup_soap_parameter_get_property):
	new function.

2004-01-29  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-response.[ch]
	(soup_soap_parameter_get_string_value): removed 'const' from return
	type.

2004-01-29  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (verify_certificate): Initialize the
	certificate before we try to use it.  Ahem.

2004-01-23  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 2.1.5 and SOUP_RELEASE to 2

2004-01-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Require at least GnuTLS 1.0.0.

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c: Fix the use of deprecated GnuTLS
	functions.
	(verify_certificate): Use gnutls_x509_crt_import() and
	gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname() instead of
	gnutls_x509_check_certificates_hostname().
	(init_dh_params): Use gnutls_dh_params_generate2() instead of
	gnutls_dh_params_generate() and gnutls_dh_params_set().

2004-01-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_close): gnutls_bye() doesn't
	close the socket itself, so we need to do it or else our
	connections stay in CLOSE_WAIT forever.

2004-01-16  Jason Leach  <leach@wam.umd.edu>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: builddir != srcdir fixes.

2004-01-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (verify_certificate): Remove the
	check for GNUTLS_CERT_CORRUPTED, it's not in 1.0.x.

2004-01-12  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: bump version and libtool revision

2004-01-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* tests/simple-httpd.c (main): Add a g_thread_init() so this works
	again.

2004-01-10  Larry Ewing  <lewing@ximian.com>

	* libsoup-2.2.pc.in (Libs): use LIBGNUTLS_LIBS in the substitution
	string.

2004-01-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* acinclude.m4: Include the libgnutls.m4 file.

	* configure.in: Remove manual checking for libgnutls-config and
	use the AM_PATH_LIBGNUTLS so we can pass in a minimum required
	version, which is 0.9.7 for now.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Some changes for the above change.

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c: Check for HAVE_SSL, not
	HAVE_GNUTLS_GNUTLS_H.
	(verify_certificate): Uncomment the SSL certificate hostname
	check.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (set_property): Be smart about flushing
	our SSL credentials only when the CA file is set to something
	different than it was before.

2004-01-09  Harish K <kharish@novell.com>
        * libsoup/soup-soap-response.c (soup_soap_response_from_string): 
        added code to ignore Header element, if present, while creating 
        response objects.  
        
2004-01-05  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Remove no-longer-relevant socklen_t check

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Reorder #includes for FreeBSD (From Joe
	Marcus Clarke, #52566)

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c: Likewise

2003-12-29  JP Rosevear <jpr@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: bump version and libtool numbers

2003-12-22  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* README, TODO: Update these

2003-12-22  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Lots of thread-safety stuff, primarly so
	you can disconnect a socket from one thread while doing I/O in
	another.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_io_cancel): Split into
	soup_message_io_stop() and io_cleanup(), to separate out the "stop
	reading/writing" and "free data" phases to allow thread-safe
	synchronous cancellation.
	(soup_message_io_finished): call both soup_message_io_stop() and
	io_cleanup()
	(io_error): Only set SOUP_STATUS_IO_ERROR on the message if it
	doesn't already have a transport error status (eg, CANCELLED).
	(new_iostate): Call io_cleanup() if needed.

	* libsoup/soup-status.h: add "SOUP_STATUS_NONE" for 0, to make it
	clearer that it's not a status.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (finalize, restarted, finished,
	soup_message_set_uri): s/soup_message_io_cancel/soup_message_io_stop/
	(soup_message_cleanup_response): s/0/SOUP_STATUS_NONE/

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (send_request): Remove
	soup_message_io_cancel call.

	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.c (send_message): Connect to the
	connection's "disconnected" signal rather than using a weak ref,
	since that's what we really care about, and it's possible that the
	connection may have an extra ref on it somewhere that would keep
	it from being destroyed even if it was disconnected.

2003-12-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (lookup_auth): If const_path is NULL un
	the non-proxy case, then use the root ("/").

2003-12-19  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-filter.c: New. An interface for objects
	that want to act on every message passing through a session.
	(Initially being used for authentication, but could also be used
	for cache handling, cookie management, etc.)

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (class_init, etc): Add a message
	filter property.
	(send_request): If the connection has a message filter set, run
	it on the message before sending it.
	(soup_connection_connect_async, etc): When setting up a tunnel, if
	we get back a 407 and the session tries to requeue the message,
	either re-send it, or return SOUP_STATUS_TRY_AGAIN (depending on
	whether or not the proxy closed the connection).
	(soup_connection_connect_sync): Likewise
	(send_request, request_done): Ref/unref the connection

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (soup_session_get_type): Implement the
	SoupMessageFilter interface.
	(soup_session_get_connection): Use the session as the connection's
	message filter
	(soup_session_add_filter, soup_session_remove_filter): Add/remove
	filters from the session
	(setup_message): do auth handling, and call each of the session's
	filters' setup_message methods as well.
	(soup_session_send_message_via): No longer needed.
	(connect_result): Handle SOUP_STATUS_TRY_AGAIN.

	* libsoup/soup-session-async.c (run_queue): Use
	soup_connection_send_request, since soup_session_send_message_via
	is gone now.

	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.c (send_message): Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_is_keepalive): A successful
	response to a CONNECT is always keepalive, even if it's HTTP/1.0
	with no Connection header.

	* libsoup/soup-status.h: add SOUP_STATUS_TRY_AGAIN

	* libsoup/soup-types.h: Add SoupMessageFilter, and macros for
	gobject interface types.

	* tests/get.c (main): Add a -p flag to specify a proxy

	* tests/simple-proxy.c: Fix #includes

2003-12-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_disconnect): Actually
	disconnect the socket rather than just unreffing it, since the IO
	code may be holding an extra ref on it.
	(send_request): connect to the "restarted" signal too
	(request_restarted): Deal with "Connection: close"

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c (ntlm_authorize_pre): Make this
	not go into an infinite loop if the server only supports Basic.

2003-12-17  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: install soup-message-queue.h with the rest
	of the headers.

	* libsoup/soup-session-sync.c: A SoupSession class for synchronous
	blocking operation for use with threaded apps.

	* libsoup/soup-types.h, libsoup/soup.h: add the new session
	subclasses

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_connect_sync): Don't
	try to unref the socket if the socket creation fails.
	(soup_connection_reserve): New, to explicitly mark a connection as
	being in use without queueing a message on it.

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (check_hostent): Oof. Fix the logic of the
	"block" flag to not be reversed.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (finished): set status to FINISHED here.
	(soup_message_cancel): Gone; needs to be done at the session
	level.

	* libsoup/soup-message-queue.c: Add a mutex and make all of the
	operations thread-safe.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (disconnect_internal): Make this
	thread-safe.
	(soup_socket_connect): Make the sync case work correctly.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: add the SoupSession subclasses

	* tests/Makefile.am: libsoup depends on libgthread now, so
	revserver doesn't need to explicitly.

	* tests/get.c, tests/auth-test.c, tests/simple-proxy.c: Use
	soup_session_async_new().

2003-12-16  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	destination protocol is HTTPS.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (class_init): Add a default handler for
	wrote_body.
	(wrote_body): Run the SOUP_HANDLER_POST_REQUEST handlers here.
	(soup_message_cancel): Don't set the status to
	SOUP_STATUS_CANCELLED and call soup_message_finished() if the
	status is already SOUP_MESSAGE_STATUS_FINISHED.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (set_property): Don't cancel the session
	if the proxy URI set as a property isn't different from the old
	one.
	(get_host_for_message): Refactor some code so that we can easily
	get the right SoupSessionHost for proxies as well as from the
	message.
	(authenticate_auth): Take a gboolean proxy parameter.  Check it to
	see which URI (message URI or proxy URI) to use for
	authentication.  Add a long comment about lack of clarity in RFC
	2617 with respect to proxies and protection spaces.

2003-12-15  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.h (soup_socket_read, soup_socket_read_until,

	added information for SOAP-ENV namespace.

2003-12-10  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c (parse_response_headers): if we
	receive an HTTP/1.0 response to an HTTP/1.1 request, downgrade the
	message's http_version so the keep-alive handling is correct.
	Fixes a problem noticed almost simultaneously by Rodrigo and Joe.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_restarted, etc): Add a
	"restarted" signal as suggested by Joe.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_io_finished): emit
	either "restarted" or "finished" as appropriate

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (soup_session_queue_message): Connect to
	"restarted" and run the queue if a message gets restarted

	* libsoup/soup-status.h: Remove a stray comma that gtk-doc doesn't
	like.

2003-12-10  Tambet Ingo  <tambet@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Use autoconfig to check for socklen_t ...

2003-11-17  Rodrigo Moya <rodrigo@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-soap-message.[ch]: new class to make it easier to
	build SOAP messages.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: added new files.

	* configure.in: increased version number.

2003-10-24  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (update_address_from_entry): Call
	soup_dns_entry_get_hostent() on the SoupAddress passed in, not the
	one in addr->priv->lookup.  Fixes a crash on synchronous DNS
	lookups.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_new): We need to ref the
	address we're binding to, because soup_socket_get_local_address()
	doesn't ref for us.

2003-10-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (init): Initialize flags to default
	values.

2003-09-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (SoupGNUTLSCred): Remove refcounting, but
	note whether or not the CA file has been loaded.
	(SoupGNUTLSChannel): add a "hostname" field.
	(verify_certificate): Remove the comment about not being able to
	verify the hostname because of soup problems. Now it's because of
	GNUTLS problems instead.
	(soup_ssl_wrap_iochannel): Renamed from soup_ssl_get_iochannel,
	and takes a hostname and a creds argument now.
	(soup_ssl_get_client_credentials,
	soup_ssl_get_server_credentials): Return client/server credentials
	structures.
	(soup_ssl_free_client_credentials,
	soup_ssl_free_server_credentials): and free them.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (class_init, set_property, get_property):
	add ssl_ca_file property
	(get_host_for_message): when returning an SSL host for the first
	time, create a client credentials structure for the session.
	(run_queue): Pass the ssl creds to the new connection. Also fix an
	unrelated bug that caused infinite loops on "bad hostname".

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Use GObject properties, including
	ssl_cert_file and ssl_key_file properties.
	(soup_server_new): Remove "protocol" argument; if the cert file
	and key file properties were set, create a server credential
	structure from them and pass that to soup_socket_server_new.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (SoupConnectionPrivate): Rename
	dest_uri to origin_uri to match RFC 2616 terminology. Add an
	"ssl_creds" field.
	(class_init, set_property, get_property): add SSL_CREDS property
	(soup_connection_connect_async, soup_connection_connect_sync):
	Pass ssl_creds to soup_socket_client_new calls.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Use GObject properties, including an
	ssl_creds property
	(soup_socket_set_flags): Gone (replaced with boolean properties)
	(soup_socket_new): Make this take a list of properties
	(listen_watch): copy ssl creds from listener to new socket
	(soup_socket_start_ssl): Pass remote hostname and socket creds
	structure to soup_ssl_wrap_iochannel.
	(soup_socket_client_new_async, soup_socket_client_new_sync,
	soup_socket_server_new): Replace the SSL boolean with an ssl_creds
	structure.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_set_ssl_ca_file,
	soup_set_ssl_cert_files, soup_get_ssl_ca_file,
	soup_get_ssl_cert_files): Gone. SSL state is now per-session or
	per-server.

	* tests/get.c: add a "-c CAfile" argument, for loading a CA
	certificate file to validate https connections against

	* tests/simple-httpd.c: Add "-c certfile" and "-k keyfile"
	arguments for loading an SSL server certificate. Only start an SSL
	server if those arguments were used.

	* tests/test-cert.pem: 
	* tests/test-key.pem: SSL certificate for testing simple-httpd

	* tests/revserver.c: Update for API changes
	* tests/simple-proxy.c: Likewise

2003-09-22  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c: Move RESPONSE_BLOCK_SIZE #define here
	from soup-private.h

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_load_config, etc): Remove all this.
	(soup_set_security_policy, soup_get_security_policy): Remove,
	since the GNUTLS backend doesn't actually implement it.
	(soup_set_ssl_ca_dir, soup_get_ssl_ca_dir): Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-misc.h: sync to soup-misc.c. Don't #include extra
	stuff.

	* libsoup/soup-types.h (SOUP_MAKE_TYPE): Move this here from
	soup-private.h

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.h: Merge soup_ssl_get_iochannel and

	(soup_ssl_get_iochannel): Renamed from soup_gnutls_get_iochannel.
	(soup_gnutls_set_security_policy): Gone

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.h
	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c: Gone; soup-ssl.h is the #include file for

	the domain

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_get_iochannel): Add some more

	s/soup_message_prepare/soup_message_cleanup_response/

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (io_read): Replace the final "\r\n"
	with "\0" on the headers before passing them to the parse
	function.
	(io_read): Call soup_message_cleanup_response after returning an
	informational response so the data doesn't leak.

	* libsoup/soup-headers.c (soup_headers_parse): Update for
	soup-message-io.c:io_read change

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_new,
	soup_server_new_with_host): Don't leak the SoupAddress.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (class_init): Make PROP_PROXY_URI not
	CONSTRUCT_ONLY.
	(set_property): If the proxy uri changes, call
	soup_session_abort() and cleanup_hosts().
	(request_finished, final_finished): Fix a bug when requeuing
	messages.

	* tests/libsoup.supp: valgrind suppression file for soup tests

	* tests/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): dist it.
	(noinst_PROGRAMS): move the former check_PROGRAMS to
	noinst_PROGRAMS instead.

2003-09-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Add wrote_informational and
	got_informational signals.

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c (get_request_headers): Set the
	EXPECT_CONTINUE flag on the message if that header is set.

	* libsoup/soup-message-server-io.c (parse_request_headers):

	instead of wrote_headers in the 1xx case.
	(io_read): Set read_state to BLOCKING, not NOT_STARTED after
	reading a 100 Continue response. Emit got_informational instead of
	got_headers in the 1xx case.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (soup_session_send_message): Reorder
	things to deal with the fact that the message could finish right
	away if there is a connection available and the server is very
	close.

	* libsoup/soup-status.h: Rename SOUP_STATUS_CLASS_TRANSPORT to
	SOUP_STATUS_CLASS_TRANSPORT_ERROR.

2003-09-17  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (find_oldest_connection): Fix two bugs
	(one that pruned too little, one that pruned too much).
	(queue_message): When requeuing, don't run the queue;
	final_finished will take care of that later.
	(soup_session_abort): New, to cancel all pending requests.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_connect, got_address): ref
	the socket while waiting for the address to resolve

2003-09-17  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_new): Replaces the
	three previous soup_connection_new* functions and uses gobject
	properties to set the destination and proxy uris.
	(class_init): set up two more signals, authenticate and
	reauthenticate.
	(soup_connection_send_request): virtualize
	(send_request): Default implementation

	* libsoup/soup-connection-ntlm.c: New SoupConnection subclass that
	also handles NTLM authentication. Includes all of the NTLM code
	formerly in soup-auth-ntlm.c.

	* libsoup/soup-auth-ntlm.[ch]: Gone.

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c: Remove NTLM refs

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (class_init): Add gobject properties for
	proxy, max_conns, use_ntlm. Change the "authenticate" and
	"reauthenticate" signal prototypes to not pass a SoupAuth (so they

	doesn't use a SoupAuth).
	(soup_session_new): Renamed from soup_session_new_default.
	(soup_session_new_with_options): Replaces
	soup_session_new_with_proxy and soup_session_new_full. Takes
	gobject properties.

	SoupConnectionNTLM depending on our "use_ntlm" property. Connect
	to its authenticate and reauthenticate signals.
	(connection_authenticate, connection_reauthenticate): proxy these
	signals.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (update_address_from_entry): Fix a
	crasher when failing to resolve the address.

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (check_hostent): Fix some "how was this
	working before" bugs.

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c (soup_message_send_request):
	call soup_message_prepare() to clean up the existing response
	state.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (io_error): Set the read_state to DONE
	when processing an OK EOF.

	* libsoup/soup-status.h (SoupStatusClass): fix the numbering of
	these so that SOUP_STATUS_CLASS_SUCCESS is 2, etc.

	* tests/auth-test.c (authenticate, reauthenticate): Update for new
	prototypes.
	(main): Use soup_session_new.

2003-09-10  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c: Add "authenticate" and "reauthenticate"
	signals.
	(invalidate_auth): Remove the call to soup_auth_invalidate.
	(authenticate_auth): soup_auth_fn is gone. If the URI doesn't
	contain authentication, then emit "authenticate" or
	"reauthenticate" (depending on whether or not this is the first
	time we've asked for a password for this auth).
	(update_auth_internal): If the server rejects our
	username/password, don't bail out immediately. Try doing a
	"reauthenticate" first.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_set_authorize_callback): Gone

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c (soup_auth_new_from_header_list): Remove the
	"pref" arg.
	(soup_auth_invalidate): Remove this; it doesn't actually do
	anything useful for us.

	* libsoup/soup-auth-basic.c (invalidate): Remove
	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c: (invalidate): Remove
	* libsoup/soup-auth-ntlm.c: (invalidate): Remove

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c: Remove all references to "authmech".
	(soup_uri_set_auth): Remove this too.

	* tests/auth-test.c: Update to use the "authenticate" and
	"reauthenticate" signals instead of encoding usernames and
	passwords in the URIs. Add a few more test cases.

2003-09-10  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-private.h (SoupMessagePrivate): Remove the
	"status" field from here, since it's mostly used by SoupSession,
	which shouldn't need access to SoupMessagePrivate.

	* libsoup/soup-message.h (SoupMessage): Move it here.
	(SoupCallbackFn): Remove this alias for SoupMessageCallbackFn.
	(soup_message_set_uri): also moved from soup-message-private.h

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: s/msg->priv->status/msg->status/.

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c:
	s/SoupCallbackFn/SoupMessageCallbackFn/ everywhere.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_io_client,
	soup_message_io_server, soup_message_io_unpause): Don't set up an
	idle handler, just jump right in to reading/writing; if this is a
	synchronous socket, then the caller wants to block, and if it's
	not, then we'll quickly get an EAGAIN anyway.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c: (queue_message): Likewise.
	(*) Update for SoupMessageStatus move and remove
	soup-message-private.h include.

	* libsoup/soup-server-message.c: Remove soup-message-private.h
	include.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Likewise.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_is_connected,
	soup_connection_is_new): Remove these, since they weren't being
	used.

	* libsoup/soup-md5-utils.c: Moved from md5-utils.c and renamed, to
	avoid namespace pollution.

	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c: Update for that.
	* libsoup/soup-server-auth.c: Likewise

	* tests/auth-test.c: Remove soup-message-private.h include

2003-09-09  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	Beginnings of improved synchronous API support

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c: Simplify this by making it not automatically
	return the result: force the caller to poll. (This isn't really a
	performance issue: the results should come back quickly anyway.)
	Also, make the cache thread-safe.
	(soup_dns_entry_from_name): Was soup_gethostbyname
	(soup_dns_entry_from_addr): Was soup_gethostbyaddr
	(soup_dns_entry_check_lookup): Used to poll to see if DNS is done
	(soup_dns_entry_get_hostent): Gets the hostent from an entry (and
	blocks if it's not resolved yet).

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Update for soup-dns changes.
	(soup_address_new): Don't automatically start resolving the
	hostname now, since we don't know if the caller is going to want
	it resolved synchronously or asynchronously.
	(soup_address_resolve_async): Renamed from soup_address_resolve.
	(soup_address_resolve_sync): New routine to do blocking
	synchronous DNS.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_connect): Now returns a
	status value directly when connecting synchronously.
	(soup_socket_client_new_async, soup_socket_client_new_sync):
	Separate async/sync client socket functions.
	(soup_socket_get_iochannel): Made static since it was not used
	outside soup-socket.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_new,
	soup_connection_new_proxy, soup_connection_new_tunnel): Just set
	up the data, don't actually start connecting.
	(soup_connection_connect_async, soup_connection_connect_sync): New
	async and sync SoupConnection connecting routines.
	(soup_connection_get_socket): Remove this since it wasn't being
	used.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (final_finished): Run the queue since a
	connection is now freed up.
	(run_queue): Update for soup_connection_new* changes.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_substring_index): Remove, since it
	wasn't being used any more.

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Remove some prototypes for functions
	that no longer exist.

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c (soup_uri_copy_root): New utility function
	(copies the protocol, host, and port of a SoupUri).

	* tests/auth-test.c:
	* tests/get.c:
	* tests/simple-proxy.c: belatedly update for soup-session change

	* tests/revserver.c: Handle each new connection in its own thread,
	using synchronous SoupSocket calls.

2003-09-05  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c: Move a bunch of logic here from
	soup-context. Now the session keeps track of hosts (instead of
	having a global soup_hosts hash) and their connections.
	(soup_session_new_with_proxy, soup_session_new_full): New session
	constructors to specify a proxy or a proxy and connection limits
	(send_request): Add Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers
	before sending off the request.
	(soup_session_queue_message, et al): Improve the way this works.
	There's no need to use timeouts to wait for connections to become
	free; we *know* when they become free.

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Remove SoupHost and some other
	no-longer-used stuff.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_set_proxy, soup_get_proxy,
	soup_set_connection_limit, soup_set_connection_limit): Gone. These
	are all per-session now.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Remove all SoupContext references
	(mostly replaced with SoupUri references)
	(cleanup_message): priv->connect_tag and priv->connection are gone
	now, so this was just soup_message_io_cancel(). So remove
	cleanup_message and replace it with that everywhere.
	(soup_message_disconnect): Gone.
	(soup_message_set_uri): Replaces soup_message_set_context.
	(soup_message_set_connection, soup_message_get_connection): Gone

	* libsoup/soup-message-server-io.c (parse_request_headers):
	s/soup_message_set_context/soup_message_set_uri/

	* libsoup/soup-status.h: Renamed from soup-error.h, with types
	and defines renamed accordingly.

	* libsoup/soup-message.h (SoupMessage): Rename errorcode to
	status_code and errorphrase to reason_phrase. Remove errorclass.
	(SOUP_MESSAGE_IS_ERROR): Remove this. You can't classify redirects
	as being either "errors" or "not errors", so its semantics are
	guaranteed to be wrong sometimes.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_set_status,
	soup_message_set_status_full): Renamed

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c
	(soup_message_add_status_code_handler,
	soup_message_add_status_class_handler): Rename.

	* libsoup/soup-session.c (soup_session_send_message): Make this
	return a status code rather than a status class.

	* libsoup/soup-message-private.h (SoupMessagePrivate): Remove some
	unrelated unused fields (retries, callback, user_data).

	* ...: Updates

2003-09-02  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-session.c: First draft at the new object to
	maintain formerly-global state. (Not yet complete; still need to
	get rid of SoupContext).

	* libsoup/soup-message-queue.c: Data structure used by SoupSession

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Gone. Mostly moved into soup-session, but
	some bits went into soup-connection.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_send_request): New,
	to send a request on a connection. The connection updates its
	internal state and then hands off to soup_message_send_request.
	(request_done): Callback set up by soup_connection_send_request.
	Marks the connection as no-longer-in-use, and disconnects it if
	the message says to.
	(soup_connection_set_in_use, soup_connection_mark_old): No longer
	needed; the connection takes care of this itself now.
	(soup_connection_new_proxy): New, to create a new connection that
	is explicitly marked as being through an HTTP proxy.
	(soup_connection_new_tunnel): New, to create a new HTTPS
	connection through a proxy. (Includes the code to send the
	CONNECT.)

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (try_existing_connections): Don't need to
	call soup_connection_set_in_use.
	(try_create_connection): Use soup_connection_new,
	soup_connection_new_proxy, or soup_connection_new_tunnel as
	appropriate.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_prepare): Replaces
	queue_message.
	(soup_message_queue, soup_message_requeue, soup_message_prepare):
	Gone. This must be done via a SoupSession now.
	(soup_message_set_connection): don't need to mark in_use/not
	in_use. Also, msg->priv->socket is gone now.
	(soup_message_get_socket): Gone.

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c (soup_message_run_handlers):
	Remove references to global handlers.
	(redirect_handler, authorize_handler): Moved to soup-session.c.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_shutdown): Gone; just unref the
	session to shut down now.

	* libsoup/soup.h: add soup-session.h

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: updates

	* tests/auth-test.c, tests/get.c, tests/simple-proxy.c: Use
	SoupSession.

2003-08-29  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c: Major rewrite. There is now only a
	single IO state object (instead of one for reading and one for
	writing), and the IO code handles switching back and forth between
	reading and writing as appropriate (including handling the extra
	switches needed for "Expect: 100-continue").
	(soup_message_io_client, soup_message_io_server): The new entry
	points.
	(soup_message_io_cancel): If the caller cancels the IO when we
	were expecting to read more data, disconnect the socket.

	* libsoup/soup-message.h (SoupMessageFlags): add
	SOUP_MESSAGE_EXPECT_CONTINUE, to indicate that the IO code should
	do the special expect-continue handling.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Move all the signal stuff here. Remove
	the "done_reading" and "done_writing" signals and replace them
	with a single "finished" signal. (A single signal. Say that 10
	times fast!)
	(soup_message_got_headers, etc): Functions to emit signals.
	(got_headers, got_chunk, got_body): Default signal methods that
	call soup_message_run_handlers.
	(finished): Default signal method that replaces
	soup_message_issue_callback.
	([various]): s/soup_message_issue_callback/soup_message_finished/
	(soup_message_requeue): There's no soup_message_set_read_callbacks
	any more, so if the caller requeues while it's still reading, just
	cancel the read.
	(soup_message_add_chunk, soup_message_add_final_chunk,
	soup_message_pop_chunk): Moved here from soup-server-message,
	although we don't actually quite support using chunked encoding
	for requests yet.

	* libsoup/soup-server-message.c (soup_server_message_new): No
	longer takes a socket argument.
	(soup_server_message_add_chunk, soup_server_message_get_chunk):
	Moved into SoupMessage.

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c (global_handlers): Make these
	POST_BODY rather than PRE_BODY, so they won't mess up the IO
	channel when the requeue the message.
	(soup_message_run_handlers): Don't need to issue the message
	callback from here any more.
	(authorize_handler): Just leave the error as 401 or 407 (see
	soup-error.h change)

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c (soup_message_send_request):
	Replaces soup_message_write_request and
	soup_message_read_response.

	* libsoup/soup-message-server-io.c: Parallel to
	soup-message-client-io.c, this defines the server-side header
	handling.
	(soup_message_read_request): Its entry point.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Lots of code moved into
	soup-message-server-io.c. Update for other changes.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Update for changes

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (read_from_network, soup_socket_write):
	Don't call soup_socket_disconnect() on an error, just return
	SOUP_SOCKET_ERROR. Otherwise soup_socket_disconnect() could emit
	signals that will mess up the caller of the read/write function.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_disconnect): When
	disconnecting the socket, disconnect from its signals first to
	prevent bad reentrancy.

	* libsoup/soup-error.h: Kill off SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE and
	SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE_PROXY, since they don't really say
	anything that SOUP_ERROR_UNATHORIZED and
	SOUP_ERROR_PROXY_UNAUTHORIZED don't say. (And now, all of the
	"transport" errors actually are transport-related.)

	* tests/auth-test.c (main): s/CANT_AUTHENTICATE/UNAUTHORIZED/

	* tests/simple-proxy.c: Complicate this a bunch. In particular,
	use SOUP_MESSAGE_OVERWRITE_CHUNKS and the GOT_CHUNK signal, and
	pass the data back to the client in chunked format.

2003-08-27  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-types.h: New header with typedefs, to avoid
	#include loops among other headers.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (libsoupinclude_HEADERS): add it

	* libsoup/*.[ch], tests/*.c: Update for soup-types.h
	
2003-08-26  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-client-io.c (soup_message_write_request,
	soup_message_read_response): Higher-than-soup-message-io-level
	functions to do client-side IO. (Code that used to be in
	soup-queue.c)
	(get_request_header_cb): Fix a bug in the generation of the Host:
	header; need to include the port number if it's not the default.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_write,
	soup_message_write_simple): Take separate user_datas for the get_*
	callbacks and the done callbacks.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Update to use soup_message_write_request
	and soup_message_read_response.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_new): Change the
	prototype to take a SoupUri and a callback.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (try_create_connection,
	soup_context_connect_cb): Update for soup_connection_new change.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (read_done_cb, issue_bad_request): Update
	for soup_message_write changes

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c (soup_uri_uses_default_port): new utility
	function

2003-08-26  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-private.h: Define SoupMessage signal stuff
	(READ_HEADERS, READ_CHUNK, READ_BODY, READ_ERROR, WROTE_HEADERS,
	WROTE_CHUNK, WROTE_BODY, WRITE_ERROR).

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (class_init): set up signals
	(requeue_read_finished): Update for changes.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_read): Split out
	parse_headers_cb from read_headers_cb. Also add a SoupDataBuffer *
	arg to say where to store the message body. Set up
	read_headers_cb, read_chunk_cb, read_body_cb, and error_cb as
	signal handlers.
	(do_read): Call r->parse_headers_cb, then emit READ_HEADERS
	(read_body_chunk): emit READ_CHUNK.
	(issue_final_callback): Set r->body. emit READ_BODY.
	(failed_read): emit READ_ERROR.
	(soup_message_read_set_callbacks): Disconnect old signal handlers,
	connect new ones.
	(soup_message_read_cancel): Disconnect signal handlers.
	(soup_message_write, soup_message_write_simple): Set up
	wrote_body_cb and error_cb as signal handlers.
	(do_write): emit WROTE_HEADERS and WROTE_CHUNK, even though

	done.
	(failed_write): emit WRITE_ERROR

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_parse_headers_cb,
	soup_queue_read_headers_cb): Split this into two unequal chunks.
	(read_header_cb only runs the pre-body handlers).
	(soup_queue_read_chunk_cb, soup_queue_read_done_cb): Update
	prototypes.
	(soup_queue_write_done_cb): Update call to soup_message_read

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (parse_headers_cb): Renamed from
	read_headers_cb
	(read_done_cb): Update prototype
	(start_request): Update soup_message_read call.

2003-08-25  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c (soup_message_read,
	soup_message_write, soup_message_write_simple): Add a "user_data"
	arg, pass it to the callbacks.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_requeue,
	requeue_read_finished, requeue_read_error): Update for that

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Likewise

2003-08-25  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_new): Take a uri string
	instead of a context. Also, swap the args (so the method comes
	before the URI, just like in the protocol).
	(soup_message_new_from_uri): Like soup_messgae_new, but takes a
	SoupUri instead of a string
	(soup_message_set_request, soup_message_set_response): Replace
	soup_message_new_full.
	(cleanup_message): Was soup_message_cleanup, but is static now.
	(queue_message): Do the pre-queuing message cleanup here instead
	of in soup_queue_message.
	(soup_message_queue): Set the callback and user_data, then call
	queue_message.
	(requeue_read_error, requeue_read_finished, soup_message_requeue):
	Use queue_message
	(soup_message_get_uri): Replaces soup_message_get_context.

	* libsoup/soup-message.h (SoupMessage): Remove msg->context. (It's
	part of SoupMessagePrivate now)

	* libsoup/soup-context.c: #include soup-message-private
	(soup_context_from_uri): constify the uri arg.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Various context/uri fixes
	(proxy_https_connect): Use soup_message_new_from_uri.
	(soup_queue_message): Drastically simplified since most of the
	work is in soup-messsage.c:queue_message() now

	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c (compute_response,
	get_authorization): Use soup_message_get_uri.

	* libsoup/soup-server-auth.c (parse_digest): Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (call_handler): Likewise

	* tests/simple-httpd.c (server_callback): Likewise.

	* tests/simple-proxy.c (server_callback): Likewise

	* tests/get.c (got_url): Likewise.
	(get_url): Update soup_message_new usage.

	* tests/auth-test.c: #include soup-message-private. Update for
	context changes and soup_message_new change.

2003-08-22  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message-private.h: New file containing
	SoupMessagePrivate and some other soup-message-internal
	types/functions. Also includes the new, expanded SoupMessageStatus
	enum.

	* libsoup/soup-message-io.c: Replaces what used to be in
	soup-transfer, but now all the interfaces take SoupMessages
	instead of SoupReader/SoupWriter and deal with maintaining
	msg->priv->{read,write}_state themselves. Fixes up all the
	refcounting madness.

	* libsoup/soup-message-handlers.c: Move the handler code here,
	mostly unchanged. (But rename SoupHandlerType to SoupHandlerPhase
	to make the distinction from SoupHandlerKind clearer.)

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Update for soup-message-io and new
	SoupMessageStatus values. Remove handler code.
	(soup_message_cleanup): Remove the hack to try to preserve the
	connection if the message gets cleaned up before it finishes
	reading. soup_message_requeue handles this in the requeuing case,
	and there's no especially compelling reason to bother doing it in
	any other case. (And the soup-message-io api doesn't support
	having a read operation that's not connected to any message.)

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: remove SoupMessagePrivate

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Update for soup-message-io and new
	SoupMessageStatus values.

	* libsoup/soup-server-message.c: Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c: Gone (yay)

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (libsoup_2_2_la_SOURCES): update

2003-08-20  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Make this a GObject. (Note that since
	SoupMessage was not refcounted before, it's not really refcounted
	now either. TBF)
	(soup_message_free): Gone, replaced by g_object_unref
	(soup_message_copy, soup_message_foreach_remove_header): Remove
	these, since neither was currently functional.
	(soup_message_is_keepalive): New utility function to look at
	HTTP version and request/response headers to decide if a message
	indicates the connection should be kept alive.
	(soup_message_set_connection, soup_message_get_connection): New
	(soup_message_get_socket): New

	* libsoup/soup-server-message.c: Make this a subclass of
	SoupMessage.
	(soup_server_message_new): Now takes a SoupServer and SoupSocket
	(soup_server_message_get_server): New
	(soup_server_message_set_encoding,
	soup_server_message_get_encoding): Get/set whether the message
	should be sent with content-length or chunked encoding
	(soup_server_message_is_started, soup_server_message_is_finished):
	Private member accessors.
	(soup_server_message_add_chunk): Renamed from add_data
	(soup_server_message_get_chunk): Pops a chunk from the list.
	(soup_server_message_get_source): Gone

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Update for SoupServerMessage changes.
	(error_cb, write_done_cb): All the cleanup stuff that used to be
	here happens automatically by unreffing the message now.
	(get_response_header): Remove some erroneous leftover CGI stuff
	(issue_bad_request): add "Connection: close" to the response.
	(read_headers_cb): clean this up a bit. Reject HTTP/1.1 messages
	with no Host header as per RFC 2616.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_start_ssl): Gone
	(soup_connection_set_in_use): Let the caller set the connection to
	"not in use" even after the socket has been disconnected.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c: Use soup_message_get_connection

	* libsoup/soup-headers.c (soup_headers_parse_request): Remove the
	check on request length, since it was rejecting
	"GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n", which is a valid complete request.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Use soup_message_get_connection and
	soup_message_get_socket.
	(soup_queue_read_done_cb): Use soup_message_is_keepalive
	(proxy_https_connect_cb): Use soup_socket_start_ssl rather than
	soup_connection_start_ssl

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (finalize): disconnect the GIOChannel
	handlers if the socket hasn't been disconnected yet.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_reader_read_body_chunk,
	reader_read): Fix these so that reader_read will exit properly if
	the read is cancelled.

	* tests/auth-test.c (main): s/soup_message_free/g_object_unref/

	* tests/simple-httpd.c (server_callback): set the message to
	content-length encoding.
	* tests/simple-proxy.c (server_callback): Likewise

2003-08-19  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_read,
	soup_socket_read_until, soup_socket_write): New API for doing
	socket IO. Works both synchronously and asynchronously, and
	buffers data to prevent the "100 Continue" problem.
	(soup_socket_set_flag): Replaces formerly-private
	soup_set_sockopts. (primarily to let the caller turn off
	SOUP_SOCKET_FLAG_NONBLOCKING).

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read,
	soup_transfer_write, soup_transfer_write_simple): Take a
	SoupSocket instead of a GIOChannel. Use the new socket IO api.
	Changed the prototypes of some of the callbacks to be less
	hackish.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c (soup_connection_get_socket): Replaces
	soup_connection_get_iochannel.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c: Fix up for soup-transfer changes

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Likewise

	* tests/revserver.c: A slightly more complicated replacement for
	timeserver. (Does both reads and writes)

2003-08-19  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-socks.[ch]: Remove this. RC doesn't let you
	configure it, and no one has complained, and it looks like the
	SOCKS5 auth code doesn't actually work anyway...

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_connect): Remove SOCKS code.

	* libsoup/soup-uri.h: Remove SOUP_PROTOCOL_SOCKS4 and
	SOUP_PROTOCOL_SOCKS5

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c: Remove a references to SOCKS in a comment

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (libsoup_2_2_la_SOURCES): remove
	soup-socks.[ch]

2003-08-19  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Make this a GObject. Remove
	SoupServerMessage code (to soup-server-message.c). Remove CGI
	server code (for now?)
	(soup_server_add_handler, soup_server_remove_handler): Rename
	(from register/unregister) to make it clearer what they do.

	* libsoup/soup-server-message.c: Moved out of soup-server.c

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Remove SoupServer def

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (libsoupinclude_HEADERS,
	libsoup_2_2_la_SOURCES): add soup-server-message.[ch]

	* tests/simple-httpd.c: 
	* tests/simple-proxy.c: Update for SoupServer changes

2003-08-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (SoupAddressPrivate): Make this more like
	a struct sockaddr again (like it used to be). In particular, add
	back the "port" field. Add a bunch of macros to try (and fail) to
	simplify some of the code.
	(soup_address_new): Now returns a SoupAddress directly rather than
	a random handle, and the caller can just use g_object_unref to
	cancel the lookup. Also, the callback now uses a
	SoupKnownErrorCode rather than a special-purpose address-lookup
	error code.
	(soup_address_new_cancel): No longer needed.
	(soup_address_new_sync): Removed
	(soup_address_new_any): Replaces soup_address_ipv4_any and
	soup_address_ipv6_any.
	(soup_address_get_name, etc): Gone. Use soup_address_resolve()
	now.
	(soup_address_get_physical): Renamed from
	soup_address_get_canonical_name.
	(soup_address_get_sockaddr): Replaces soup_address_make_sockaddr()

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Update for SoupAddress changes and make
	similar changes here.
	(soup_socket_new): Just creates a generic SoupSocket now.
	(soup_socket_connect): Client setup
	(soup_socket_listen): Server setup. Now also sets up an iochannel
	listening for connects and emits a "new_connection" signal as they
	come in.
	(soup_socket_start_ssl): Turns on SSL.
	(soup_socket_client_new, soup_socket_server_new): Utility
	functions that wrap the above.
	(soup_socket_new_cancel, soup_socket_new_sync): Gone
	(soup_socket_server_accept, soup_socket_server_try_accept): No
	longer needed.
	(soup_socket_get_iochannel): No longer adds a ref when returning
	the iochannel. Also, we set it to "close_on_unref" so that if a
	caller adds a ref to it, the connection will actually remain open
	even after the SoupSocket is destroyed.
	(soup_socket_get_local_address, soup_socket_get_remote_address):
	Let the caller get both of these.

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c: Don't keep a private copy of the
	socket's iochannel.
	(soup_connection_new): Don't need to set socket options here.
	SoupSocket does it.
	(soup_connection_start_ssl): Just call soup_socket_start_ssl.
	(soup_connection_get_iochannel): Just return the socket's
	iochannel (and don't ref it)

	* libsoup/soup-error.c: add SOUP_ERROR_CANT_RESOLVE and
	SOUP_ERROR_CANT_RESOLVE_PROXY

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c (soup_ntop): Make the address arg const.
	Remove the "FIXME add a CANT_RESOLVE error" and return
	SOUP_ERROR_CANT_RESOLVE instead.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c: Update for socket/address changes. Don't
	poke into SoupSocket's private fields.
	(soup_server_run_async): Just connect to the socket's
	"new_connection" signal.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (try_create_connection,
	soup_context_connect_cb): Update for socket changes. Replace
	SOUP_CONNECT_ERROR codes with plain SOUP_ERROR codes.

	* libsoup/soup-misc.c (soup_signal_connect_once): Utility function
	to connect to a signal handler and connect another function to
	clean up the first signal handler after its first invocation.
	(Lets us use signals to replace one-off callbacks.)

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Remove SoupSocketPrivate since it is
	actually private now.
	(struct _SoupServer): Remove accept_tag.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_done_cb, start_request):
	Don't unref the iochannel.
	(soup_queue_connect_cb): Takes a SoupKnownErrorCode now.

	* libsoup/soup-socks.c: Update for socket/address changes

	* tests/simple-httpd.c (main):
	s/SOUP_SERVER_ANY_PORT/SOUP_ADDRESS_ANY_PORT/
	* tests/simple-proxy.c (main): Likewise

	* tests/timeserver.c: Update for SoupSocket's "new_connection"
	signal, and for SoupAddress changes.

2003-08-14  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-connection.c: New, split out from soup-context and
	made into a GObject.
	(soup_connection_disconnect): Disconnects the connection and emits
	a signal. (Replaces the old "keep_alive" flag.)
	(soup_connection_is_connected): Checks if the connection is still
	connected
	(connection_died): Just disconnect, rather than freeing the
	connection. This way if anyone else is still referencing it they
	won't end up with an invalid pointer.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c: Make this a GObject, remove all the
	SoupConnection code. Add an "ntlm_auths" field to SoupHost so that
	SoupContext can keep track of connection auth stuff there without
	SoupConnection needing to care. Various other updates.

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Remove SoupContext and SoupConnection
	definitions.

	* libsoup/*.c, tests/get.c: Update for context/connection changes

	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_connect_socks_proxy): Change the
	definition to deal with the fact that there's no
	soup_connection_get_context any more.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_headers_cb): Don't deal
	with connection persistence here.
	(soup_queue_read_done_cb): Do it here instead. Disconnect the
	connection when appropriate.
	(proxy_connect, proxy_https_connect, proxy_https_connect_cb):
	Reference-count the connection properly. (I think.)

	* libsoup/soup-marshal.list: New, for SoupConnection's
	"disconnected" signal.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: add rules to build soup-marshal.[ch]

	* configure.in: Use AM_PATH_GLIB_2 rather than pkg-config, so that
	GLIB_GENMARSHAL gets set too.

2003-08-14  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-error.c: Fix a spelling mistake.

	* libsoup/*.c: Fix use of @/%/#/() in gtk-doc comments

2003-08-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c: Make this an abstract GObject. Tweak some
	of the interfaces around a little bit.

	* libsoup/soup-auth-basic.c: subclass for Basic auth

	* libsoup/soup-auth-digest.c: subclass for Digest auth

	* libsoup/soup-auth-ntlm.c: subclass for NTLM auth. Move all of
	the code from soup-ntlm.c here, and make it private.

	* libsoup/soup-ntlm.c: gone

	* libsoup/soup-misc.h: Remove the definition of SoupAuthType from
	here, and change the signature of SoupAuthorizeFn.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c: Use g_object_unref to free auths, use
	methods instead of directly access private fields.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c: Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-server-auth.c (soup_server_auth_free): Remove all
	NTLM references. We have no plans to implement server-side NTLM
	auth.

	* tests/auth-test.c (identify_auth): Update for auth api changes

2003-08-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in (GLIB): add gobject-2.0 to the PKG_CHECK_MODULES
	call

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Make this a GObject.
	(soup_address_ref, soup_address_unref): Gone.
	(soup_address_copy): Gone. Wasn't being used anyway.

	* libsoup/soup-dns.c: Move all of the DNS code and caching stuff
	here from soup-address.c, so that soup-address doesn't need to
	worry about trying to cache zero-ref addresses.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Make this a GObject. Use "guint"
	consistently for port numbers.
	(soup_socket_ref, soup_socket_unref): Gone.

	* libsoup/soup-private.h: Change the SoupSocket definition to be
	SoupSocketPrivate. (Still need to keep this here since soup-server
	pokes around in its internals.)
	(SOUP_MAKE_TYPE): Copied from gal's E_MAKE_TYPE.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (read_done_cb, write_done_cb): Unref the
	reader/writer rather than leaking them.

	* libsoup/*: Use GObject methods for socket/address refcounting
	
	* tests/auth-test.c (main)
	* tests/timeserver.c (main): Call g_type_init.

	* tests/get.c (main): Call g_type_init.
	(get_url, got_url): Fix some bugs that could make -r mode get into
	infinite loops downloading the same files over and over. Plug some
	memory leaks to make this more useful for valgrinding libsoup.

	* tests/simple-httpd.c (main): Call g_type_init. Set up a signal
	handler for SIGINT so we can exit cleanly, since valgrind won't
	give a leak report if you don't. Plug a few memory leaks.

	* tests/simple-proxy.c (main): Likewise	

2003-08-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	Pull over some new test programs from the soup-refactoring branch,
	along with the SoupUri changes they depend on.

	* tests/simple-httpd.c: A really simple HTTP server, to test the
	server code.

	* tests/simple-proxy.c: An even simpler HTTP proxy

	* tests/get.c: Add "-r" flag to recursively get files (thereby
	testing multiple-connections-at-once code). Also good for setting
	up a tree to use with simple-httpd.

	* tests/timeserver.c (main): Fix a bug. (s/ipv6/ipv4/ in the
	normal case)

	* tests/uri-parsing.c: Regression test for the new soup-uri.c

	* libsoup/soup-uri.c: Rewrite/update to conform to RFC 2396, and
	pull in some optimizations from camel-url. Also, make SoupProtocol
	a GQuark so we can still compare them with ==, but we can also
	recognize any protocol.
	(soup_uri_new_with_base): New, to merge base and relative URIs
	(soup_uri_to_string): Update this. Change the "show_password" flag
	(which we always passed FALSE for) to "just_path", for places that
	want the path+query without the protocol, host, etc.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_get_request_header): Just use
	soup_uri_to_string to generate the request URI.

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c (compute_response, digest_auth_func): Use
	"soup_uri_to_path (uri, TRUE)" rather than trying to reassemble
	the URI by hand badly.
	* libsoup/soup-server-auth.c (parse_digest): Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_connect_socks_proxy): Change a
	switch() to an series of if()s since SOUP_PROTOCOL_* aren't
	constants any more.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_context_uri_hash,
	soup_context_uri_equal): s/querystring/query/

2003-08-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump API version to 2.2 and package version to
	2.1.0. Remove NSS and OpenSSL checks and proxy-related config. Use
	libgnutls-config to find GNUTLS.

	* libsoup-2.2.pc.in: Update, and rename from soup-2.0.pc

	* Makefile.am: Update for pc file rename

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: s/2.0/2.2/ everywhere. Remove NSS, OpenSSL,
	and libsoup-ssl-proxy stuff.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c
	* libsoup/soup-nss.[ch]
	* libsoup/soup-openssl.[ch]: gone

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c: remove NSS and OpenSSL bits

	* tests/Makefile.am (get_LDADD, timeserver_LDADD,
	auth_test_LDADD): Update libsoup version

2003-08-07  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c (soup_auth_lookup, soup_auth_set_context,
	soup_auth_invalidate): These are all really SoupContext functions,
	so move them to soup-context.c (and rename them appropriately).
	(soup_auth_get_protection_space): New method to get the
	"protection space" of an auth (paths where it is valid).
	(soup_auth_invalidate): New method to try to un-authenticate an
	auth (so we can keep the domain info cached even if the auth info
	is wrong).
	(basic_pspace_func): Basic protection space is all directories
	below the current one.
	(basic_invalidate_func): Clear the encoded username/password
	(digest_pspace_func): Digest protection space is either the whole
	server, or "what the domain parameter says" (though we don't deal
	with cross-host domains).
	(digest_invalidate_func): Return FALSE; bad digest auth info isn't
	cacheable.
	(digest_parse_func, digest_free): Set/free domain parameter
	(ntlm_pspace): NTLM protection space is always the whole server.
	(ntlm_invalidate): Clear the auth state.
	(soup_auth_new_ntlm): Make this non-static
	(SoupAuth): Replace the quad-state "status" field with an
	"authenticated" boolean.
	
	* libsoup/soup-private.h (SoupHost): Replace the "valid_auths"
	hash with separate "auth_realms" (path->realm) and "auths"
	(realm->auth) hashes. Also add a "use_ntlm" flag.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_context_unref): Update SoupHost
	freeing code.
	(connection_free): Don't the connection's auth, just free it.
	(soup_context_lookup_auth): Formerly soup_auth_lookup, but now
	does two-stage lookup (path->realm then realm->auth) and also
	deals with NTLM hacks.
	(soup_context_update_auth): Mostly formerly soup_auth_set_context,
	but also large parts of authorize_handler. Updates the auth hashes
	based on information from a 401 or 407 response. Does a better job
	than authorize_handler did of not throwing away good information.
	(soup_context_preauthenticate): New; fakes up auth info so that
	requests will end up using authentication without the server
	needing to return an error first.
	(soup_context_authenticate_auth): Moved out of authorize_handler
	so it can be used at request-sending time too, if we know that we
	need it. (That way we can avoid requeuing the request if it isn't
	going to be able to be authenticated.)
	(soup_context_invalidate_auth): Sort of like the old
	soup_auth_invalidate, but only destroys the auth data, while still
	remembering the path->realm mapping.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (authorize_handler): Mostly moved into
	soup_context_update_auth.
	(maybe_validate_auth): Remove this; it was only useful because of
	bugs elsewhere in the auth handling.
	
	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_encode_http_auth): Update for
	soup_context_lookup_auth. If the returned auth isn't
	authenticated, call soup_context_authenticate_auth() on it.

	* tests/auth-test.c: New (from soup-refactoring branch). Tests
	that the Basic/Digest auth code does the right thing. (TODO: find
	a good way to add NTLM tests too.)

	* tests/Makefile.am (check_PROGRAMS): add auth-test

2003-07-29  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.99.25 ("Potato and Leek Soup")

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (requeue_read_finished,
	release_connection): Free the passed-in body data. Otherwise the
	response body ends up getting leaked on most 3xx and 4xx
	responses.
	(soup_message_cleanup): Remove a piece of code that didn't
	actually do anything and its associated confused comment.

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c (ntlm_free): plug an occasional NTLM auth leak

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (connection_free): plug a non-occasional
	NTLM auth leak.

2003-06-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Version 1.99.24

2003-06-24  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Check pkgconfig for openssl, since 0.9.7 (a) uses
	it, and (b) depends on lots of new things sometimes (like on RH9).

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c: 
	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c: Change #ifdef HAVE_OPENSSL_SSL_H to
	just #ifdef HAVE_OPENSSL since the header check doesn't get run in
	the pkgconfig case

2003-06-19  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_done_cb): unref the
	old read_tag before changing/clearing it.
	(soup_queue_write_done_cb): Likewise with the write_tag.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (issue_final_callback): ref the reader
	around the stop+callback.
	(soup_transfer_write_cb): Likewise.

2003-06-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (SoupReader, SoupWriter): add a
	ref_count field.
	(soup_transfer_read, create_writer): Set initial ref_count to 2
	(one for soup-transfer, one for the caller).
	(soup_transfer_read_ref, soup_transfer_read_unref): ref/unref a
	reader
	(soup_transfer_read_stop): Clears the GIOChannel callbacks and
	drops soup-transfer's ref.
	(soup_transfer_read_cancel): Now just a stop+unref
	(soup_transfer_write_ref, soup_transfer_write_unref,
	soup_transfer_write_stop, soup_transfer_write_cancel): Similarly.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_cleanup): when setting up
	the "finish reading" callbacks, unref the reader so it will be
	destroyed once it's done reading.
	(soup_message_requeue): Likewise.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_read_headers_cb): Update for
	prototype change (no longer returns a SoupTransferDone).
	(soup_queue_read_chunk_cb): Likewise.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (read_headers_cb): Likewise

2003-06-11  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c: Change all functions to take a
	SoupReader * or SoupWriter * instead of a guint.

	* libsoup/soup-private.h (SoupMessagePrivate): make read_tag and
	write_tag pointers instead of guints.

2003-06-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c: remove #include for soup-nss.h

2003-06-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): remove NSS_CFLAGS.
	(libsoup_2_0_la_LIBADD): remove NSS_LIBS.
	(libsoup_2_0_la_SOURCES): remove soup-nss.[ch]

2003-06-02  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.99.23.

2003-05-30  Chris Toshok  <toshok@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): always force a
	reconnect when there's an error with ssl connection.  This fixes
	#43387, but it runs the risk of sending requests multiple times to
	the exchange server, and it results in lots of shorter lived
	connections and more forking (in the ssl proxy case), depending on
	the length of the operation.

2003-05-21  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.99.22 (codename: French Onion Soup)

2003-05-20  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_requeue): Clear the
	write_tag as well so we don't double-cancel it. #43395.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): The connection might
	be destroyed by the end of the func, so we have to call
	soup_connection_set_used at the beginning.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_read, soup_openssl_write):
	Call g_set_error() so that we don't SEGV immediately after
	returning G_IO_STATUS_ERROR.

2003-05-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump version to 1.99.21

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_connect): If the proxy HTTPS
	tunnelling fails, the other message which shares our same
	connection will free it first, so set ours to NULL.

2003-05-08  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-auth.c (ntlm_auth): If the auth status is PENDING,
	return an NTLM request string. Otherwise return the "response"
	field (which should include the NTLM authenticate message)
	(ntlm_init): Don't bother setting "response" to the NTLM request
	string. Just leave it NULL in that case.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (authorize_handler): Never try to reuse
	an NTLM auth returned from soup_auth_lookup. Only set the auth on
	the connection when it's SOUP_AUTH_STATUS_SUCCESSFUL. Otherwise,
	call soup_auth_set_context() on it just like for non-NTLM auth.
	The net effect of all of this is that now we record when a context
	needs NTLM auth just like with non-NTLM auth, so that that info
	gets preserved across connections.
	(soup_message_requeue): No longer need the hackery here to
	preserve the connection auth state.

2003-05-07  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_connection_set_in_use): New, to
	toggle the connection's in_use flag, and set up the death watch
	when it's not in use.
	(connection_death): This is only hooked up when the connection is
	not in use now, so don't need to check that. Should fix the
	infinite connection_death loop.
	(soup_connection_is_new): Keep a distinct "new" flag rather than
	defining "new" as "has been released at least once".
	(soup_connection_set_used): Mark a connection no-longer new.
	(soup_context_connect_cb): Mark the connection as new. Don't set
	up the death watch since it's in_use.
	(try_existing_connections): Use soup_connection_set_in_use.
	(soup_connection_release): Likewise

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (requeue_read_finished): Call
	soup_connection_set_used so that the connection isn't still
	considered new when we send the message the second time.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): Call
	soup_connection_set_used (assuming we don't close the connection)
	(soup_queue_read_done_cb): Likewise.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_cb): If we read
	nothing, call soup_transfer_read_error_cb rather than just
	cancelling, or else it will get cancelled again later.

2003-05-07  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* soup-2.0.pc.in (Libs): Don't put @OPENSSL_LIBS@ here; the
	library doesn't depend on them, only the proxy does. #42473

2003-05-06  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* src/libsoup/soup-message.c (global_handlers): Change the
	redirect handler to be a RESPONSE_ERROR_CLASS_HANDLER for
	SOUP_ERROR_CLASS_REDIRECT rather than a RESPONSE_HEADER_HANDLER
	for "Location" to get around the non-64-bit-clean union
	initialization pointed out by Jeremy Katz <katzj@redhat.com>.
	(redirect_handler): Update for that.

2003-04-28  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.99.20

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_error_cb): Make sure
	we always call UNIGNORE_CANCEL. Might fix #41971

2003-04-25  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): if an old connection
	suddenly gets an io error while reading or writing, assume it's a
	timeout or something, close the connection, and requeue the
	message.

2003-04-23  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_cleanup): Don't set up the
	soup-transfer callbacks to keep reading off the connection unless
	we're actually going to keep the connection around afterward.
	Otherwise we can just close it.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c: Re-kludge the awful IGNORE_CANCEL
	thingy so that it's possible to cancel a read from inside a
	callback so that the above change actually works instead of just
	crashing.

2003-04-20  Rodney Dawes  <dobey@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Up version to 1.99.18
	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Line separator after GNUTLS_CFLAGS
	
2003-04-11  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_connection_purge_idle): New
	function to close all idle connections. (Needed for #41117 or else
	there's no way to force-discard NTLM authentication.)

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_shutdown): Use it

2003-04-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_https_connect):
	proxy_https_connect_cb() might not get called if connecting to the
	proxy fails, and it causes us to double-free the connection.
	Always set the message's connection to NULL before freeing it.

2003-04-09  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: 1.99.17

2003-04-07  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (connection_death): Revert Joe's changes.
	We can't release the connection there because there may be
	SoupMessages still pointing to it. (Needs to be revisited.)

2003-04-03  JP Rosevear  <jpr@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_hup_waitpid): guard against EINTR
	error during waitpid

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: ditto

2003-04-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (connection_death): Only drop the
	connection if we get an error condition on the channel.  Fixes a
	double-free.

2003-04-02  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (connection_death): Just call
	soup_connection_release() from here and return whether the
	connection is in use.

2003-03-31  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c (soup_gnutls_close): loop on gnutls_bye in
	case of EAGAIN or EINTR, since shutting down an SSL connection
	requires more than just closing a socket.

2003-03-28  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_set_context): If the new
	context points to a different server from the old context, call
	soup_message_cleanup. Otherwise it tries to reuse the old
	connection...

2003-03-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.16

2003-03-24  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* soup-error.[ch]: Add SOUP_ERROR_SSL_FAILED which gives a
	slightly better error message on various SSL failures than the
	previous message.

	* soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): Throw the
	SOUP_ERROR_SSL_FAILED error when we fail an SSL handshake.

2003-03-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* soup-server.c: Use non-deprecated g_main_loop_* calls
	throughout.
	(soup_server_unref): Don't unref the main loop if it's NULL.
	Fixes a glib warning.

2003-03-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: comment out NSS checks. The NSS code doesn't work
	and there are no current plans to fix it.

	* README (Features): Mention GnuTLS, remove NSS and the rest of
	the "Planned Features" section.

	* MAINTAINERS: remove Alex

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_get_iochannel): Bump the
	timeout to 10 seconds (and get rid of the 3 tries) so we don't
	fail to connect just because the server is slow/far away.

2003-03-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.15.

2003-03-12  Ian Peters  <itp@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-gnutls.c: because creating client credentials is
	expensive, keep the same one around as long as possible, only
	recreating it if the ssl_ca_file changes.  Wrap
	gnutls_certificate_credentials in a refcounted struct to avoid
	freeing it while another established connection may potentially
	need it (say, to rehandshake).

2003-03-11  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* soup-2.0.pc.in: add ssl libs to defaults, since ssl doesn't 
	use pkgconfig

2003-03-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.14.

	* configure.in, libsoup/Makefile.am, libsoup/soup.gnutls.[ch],
	libsoup/soup-ssl.c: Add support for GnuTLS.  Patch from Ian
	Peters.

2003-03-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.13.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_context_connect_cb): Add G_IO_IN to
	the list of conditions to watch.  If the remote end hangs up the
	connection, we'll get a successful read of 0 bytes, not a HUP.
	The connection will have to be released by the point we check for
	it in connection_death().

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (soup_queue_error_cb): Get rid of some
	(apparently) errant resetting of the read and write tags.  I think
	this might have been causing some reentrancy and crashes.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_get_iochannel): Set the IO
	channel to NULL encoding and not buffered.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_cb): Remove some
	incorrect comments.

2003-02-28  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.12.

	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_cb): We can get a
	header_len of 0 and a total_read of 0 in the case of a SIGPIPE; in
	this case we probably don't want to call the error callback, we
	just want to act like our transfer was cancelled.

2003-02-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	Try to apply some order to the iochannel refcounting...

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.11.

	* libsoup/soup-context.c (soup_connection_get_iochannel): The
	connections needs to own a reference to the iochannel!  If we're
	using HTTPS, release the ref we get from soup_socket_get_iochannel
	and replace it with the ref we get from soup_ssl_get_iochannel().
	Then, always ref the channel that we return (ugh, but that's the
	soup way).
	(connection_free): Release the connection's ref to the iochannel.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_get_iochannel_real): Ref the
	iochannel. The reference we pass back will be owned by the
	connection.
	(soup_ssl_hup_waitpid): Release our ref.

2003-02-27  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.10.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_get_iochannel_real): Ref the
	iochannel, return to the status quo.  Sigh.

2003-02-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.9.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_hup_waitpid): Comment out the unref,
	it's causing problems with HTTPS and proxies; the iochannel
	refcounting is waaaaaay horked.

2003-02-26  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: added workaround to link ssl-proxy statically

2003-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.8 for snaps.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_gethostbyname): Fix this for Solaris.
	It returns the address to the resulting hostent or NULL on failure,
	unlike Linux which returns an error code.

2003-02-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.7 for snaps.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_get_iochannel): Print out
	the error string from OpenSSL if we can't establish a connection.

2003-02-04  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.6 for snaps.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (destroy_message): We already assigned
	chan, so don't reassign it, and unref it in all cases.
	(issue_bad_request): Always unref after a call to
	soup_socket_get_iochannel(), because it refs it.
	(conn_accept): Fix some funky GIOChannel reffing here.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_get_iochannel_real): Don't call
	g_io_channel_ref() on the socket.  This is the exact opposite of
	what we want to do.  Create a temporary structure containing the
	parent pid and the old socket and unref the socket when our
	callback is called.  This should fix GIOChannels being leaked on
	SSL connections.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c: Always close the GIOChannels after the
	main loop quits.

2003-01-22  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Bump up to 1.99.5 for the snaps.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_new): If we found the
	address in our hash, we need to return NULL or else Soup will
	think we're doing an async lookup and do some cancellation on
	us.  Besides, we were returning the wrong type anyway and it
	was crashing things.

2003-01-17  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (soup_ssl_proxy_readwrite): It's not
	uncommon for us to get a G_IO_ERROR_AGAIN when trying to write
	out, so keep trying until we succeed.

2003-01-10  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (verify_cb): Load some X509 and SSL error
	strings and print out the error when the cert can't verify.

2003-01-09  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_gethostbyname): Fix a memcpy
	overrun noticed by valgrind

2002-12-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_new_with_host): Added.
	Starts a server only on the interface specified, instead of all
	network interfaces.

2002-12-16  Jeremy Katz  <katzj@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: use $libdir instead of /usr/lib when looking for
	libraries

2002-12-11  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_https_connect_cb): I am an idiot.
	Don't set a variable to NULL and then immediately try to
	dereference it.

2002-12-09  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_get_iochannel): Put a
	timeout on the select()s when we get SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ/WRITE so
	we don't hang forever if we don't get more data.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (main): Don't set our fds to blocking
	or else we'll hang forever in SSL_connect() if the other side
	hangs up.

	* libsoup/soup-queue.c (proxy_https_connect_cb): We never want to
	release the connection on message free, even if the connection was
	unsuccessful.

2002-12-03  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-ssl.c (soup_ssl_get_iochannel_real): Call
	g_io_channel_set_close_on_unref() on the second half of the socket
	pair so we don't leak file descriptors.

2002-12-03  Frank Belew	 <frb@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: add signal.h to the list of headers to 
	pick up SIGKILL
	
2002-11-25  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Build the tests directory again

2002-11-21  Rodney Dawes  <dobey@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Don't require autoconf 2.5x, needs to work with 2.13
	
2002-11-20  Michael Meeks  <michael@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: require autoconf 2.52 not 2.53.

2002-11-18  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_hash): Don't use s6_addr32
	since it's apparently non-portable. Use s6_addr instead.
	(soup_gethostbyaddr): fix a sometimes-uninitialized variable.

	* libsoup/soup-error.c: Fix spelling of
	SOUP_ERROR_MOVED_PERMANENTLY and its description.

	* libsoup/soup-message.c (soup_message_get_request_header, etc):
	Remove long-deprecated API.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c (soup_socket_connect): remove unused
	variable.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_read): Use gsize.
	* libsoup/soup-server.c (cgi_read): Likewise
	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_socks_write, soup_socks_read):
	Likewise.
	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (soup_ssl_proxy_readwrite): Likewise.
	* libsoup/soup-transfer.c (soup_transfer_read_cb,
	soup_transfer_write_cb): Likewise.

	* tests/timeserver.c: Add "-6" to listen on the IPv6 local address
	instead of IPv4. (Tested on OS X.)

2002-11-15  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/*: Change old Helix Code refs to Ximian (and update
	copyright dates).

2002-11-15  Frank Belew  <frb@ximian.com>

	* tests/Makefile.am: uncomment lines to make timeserver build 
	correctly
	
2002-11-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c (soup_address_new): When we get an
	address from the hash, call our address lookup callback or else
	the connection will hang.

2002-11-13  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* tests/timeserver.c: Oops, commit this.

	* tests/Makefile.am (noinst_PROGRAMS): reenable timeserver.

2002-11-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Replace the BINDIR define with LIBEXECDIR.
	(install-exec-hook): Install libsoup-ssl-proxy into libexecdir
	instead of bindir.

	* libsoup/soup-openssl.c (soup_openssl_close): Call SSL_shutdown()
	to properly shut down the SSL connection before closing the
	socket.

	* libsoup/soup-ssl-proxy.c (soup_ssl_proxy_readwrite): Close the
	iochannels before quitting the main loop.

	* tests/Makefile.am: disable building timeserver, the source file
	wasn't added.

2002-11-12  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: Check for IPv6 support in networking headers.

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Make the internal structure of
	SoupAddress entirely private, and make SoupAddress be more like a
	hostent and less like a sockaddr. (Ie, make it not have a port
	associated with it.) Document undocumented functions. Add
	completely-untested support for IPv6.
	(soup_address_new_from_sockaddr): New, to parse a sockaddr into a
	SoupAddress and a port.
	(soup_address_ipv4_any, soup_address_ipv6_any): Return static
	addresses corresponding to the IPv6 and IPv6 "any" addresses.
	(soup_address_get_canonical_name): Use inet_ntop/inet_ntoa.
	(soup_address_make_sockaddr): Now constructs a new sockaddr, which
	may be a sockaddr_in or sockaddr_in6.
	(soup_address_gethostname, soup_address_gethostaddr): Remove
	these. They aren't reliable, especially on multihomed hosts.
	(soup_gethostbyname, soup_gethostbyaddr): support IPv6
	(soup_address_new): Keep pending lookups in a separate hash table
	from completed lookups. Fix a bug when canceling a lookup when
	there was more one outstanding request for it.
	(soup_address_lookup_in_cache): Removed.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Add a port field to SoupSocket (since
	it's not in SoupAddress any more).
	(soup_socket_connect): Simplify this. Don't use
	soup_address_lookup_in_cache, just call soup_address_new, since we
	already know the code can deal with the callback being invoked
	immediately.
	(soup_socket_new_sync, soup_socket_new): Take a port argument.
	(soup_socket_server_new): Take a SoupAddress to use as the local
	address to bind to. This lets the caller choose between the IPv4
	and IPv6 "any" addresses, and also lets you bind to a single
	interface of a multi-homed machine.
	(soup_socket_server_accept, soup_socket_server_try_accept): Merge
	the common code.

	* libsoup/soup-server.c (soup_server_new): Pass
	soup_address_ipv4_any() to soup_socket_server_new().

	* libsoup/soup-socks.c (soup_connect_socks_proxy,
	soup_socks_write): Fix up for the API changes, but it won't work
	with IPv6 yet.

	* tests/timeserver.c: Another really simple test, for the server
	socket code.

	* tests/Makefile.am: build timeserver

2002-11-11  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* libsoup/soup-address.c: Move the SoupAddress code from
	soup-socket.c and soup-socket-unix.c to here.

	* libsoup/soup-socket.c: Move the remaining code from
	soup-socket-unix.c here.

	* libsoup/soup-socket-unix.c: Gone

	* tests/get.c: really really trivial test program

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT):
	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): add tests/

2002-11-05  Dan Winship  <danw@ximian.com>

	* Split libsoup out of soup. ChangeLog.old contains the original
	soup ChangeLog.

	* Makefile.am, etc: Fix things up to work with the new directory
	layout. Disable docs until we fix them.

	* autogen.sh: Use gnome-autogen.sh

	* configure.in: Require autoconf 2.53. Remove stuff that was only
	needed for httpd or wsdl code. Remove glib1 support. Bump version
	to 2.0.

	* libsoup/Makefile.am: Rename library to libsoup-2.0, put includes
	in ${includedir}/soup-2.0
	
	* libsoup/*: Merge soup-0-7 back onto the trunk. Remove
	SOAP-specific stuff, Windows support, and other things that
	weren't being maintained.

	* soup-config.in, soupConf.sh: Kill these. We only support
	pkg-config now.
